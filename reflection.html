        --> Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?<br>
        Responsive design is a method of developing web pages that makes use of flexible layouts, flexible graphics, and media queries in the form of cascading style sheets. The goal of responsive design is to generate
        web pages that recognise the visitor's screen size and orientation screen and adjust the layout as needed. 
		Responsive design is a somewhat retro approach to web site design that addresses many of the design issues that have arisen as a result of the growth of new sorts of mobile devices. Instead of fixed-width settings, responsive design pages employ X and Y coordinates on a grid for layout and mathematical percentages for pictures. Using percentages instead of fixed-width parameters with a grid layout results in a more fluid layout that adapts to the size of the display.<br>
    
    <br>        --> How does responsive design relate to web technologies? <br>
        Responsive web design, often known as RWD design, is a current web design strategy that allows websites and pages to render (or display) across all devices and screen sizes by changing to the screen automatically, whether it's a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. 
		CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used in responsive web design to serve different style properties based on the user's device's screen size, orientation, resolution, colour capability, and other features. CSS properties that are relevant to responsive web design include viewport and media queries.<br>

    <br>        --> What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your research? <br>
        Web app is an interactive computer program, built with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), which stores (Database, Files) and manipulates data (CRUD), and is used by a team or single user to perform tasks over the internet. To make a proper web app we need to understand:
        <br><br>
        1) Backend language (e.g. Python, Ruby) - control how your web app works
    <br>    2) Web front end (HTML, CSS, Javascript) - for the look and feel of your web app
    <br>    3) DevOps (Github, Jenkins) - Deploying / hosting your web app
<br>
    <br>        --> Finally, describe your learning experience in the course? <br>
	This course taught me about the World Wide Web and the HTTP protocol. How to create web client applications that adhere to current standards and best practises, use a document object model to present content for end-user consumption and/or interaction, and use JavaScript to implement interactivity in a web client application. Use the hypertext mark-up language to create web-based documents. To control the appearance of web documents, use cascading style sheets. Solve a variety of common web client programming issues.
